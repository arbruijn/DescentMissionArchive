DXMA (Descent Mission Archive; X standing in for 1, 2, 3, etc.) is a PHP web application that
provides an interface for uploading and searching mission files for Descent games (as well as Overload).

The program requires PHP 7 as well as MySQL (with InnoDB or a compatible storage engine). When installed,
the application should be configured by modifying config.php under the config folder.
